The objectives are to conduct dendrochronological collections in the Jemez Mountains (New Mexico) region during 2007 and 2008 for reconstructions of hydrological variability over past centuries; including:\r\n1.\tDendrochronological collections from two previously-collected tree-ring sites, based on the strength of the hydroclimatic signal and potential to both update and extend the chronology back in time with remnant material.\r\n2.\tDendrochronological collections from one new chronology from a moisture-stressed site with old trees and remnant material.\r\n3.\tProcessing of wood from all three sites into three site tree-ring chronologies.\r\n4.\tDevelop and analyze preliminary dendrohydrological reconstructions several centuries in length.\r\n",
