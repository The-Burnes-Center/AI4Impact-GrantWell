The Airspace Systems Program will directly address the Air Traffic Management (ATM) research needs of the Next Generation Air Transportation Systems (NGATS) initiative as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). The Aviation Safety Program will take a proactive approach to address safety challenges of new and legacy vehicles in order to enhance the safety of the Nations current and future air transportation system. The Fundamental Aeronautics Program will pursue long-term, cutting edge research in all flight regimes to produce data, knowledge, and design tools that will be applicable across a broad range of air vehicles. The Aeronautics Test Program, residing under NASAs Shared Capability Assets Program (SCAP), will protect and preserve key aeronautics test facilities. The structure of the ROA NRA will require that proposals be submitted to the most relevant aeronautics program elements, which will be described in Appendices to the NRA. Specific Proposal submission deadline dates, any particular evaluation criteria, and submission points of contact by NASA Center will also be identified in the NRA Appendices. Proposals must be submitted electronically, and all proposers may use NASAs proposal data system, NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com     ), or Grants.gov. Electronic submission of proposals is required, and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Individual program elements under this solicitation may be found by using the Advanced Search method in Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov/search/advanced.do).  In the \"Search by Funding Opportunity Number\" box, enter the ROA solicitation number of NNH07ZEA001N followed by an * (i.e., NNH07ZEA001N*).  This will result in a list of all posted program elements.  Use the funding number associated with the program element you wish to apply for to download the application package.  With the exception of government organizations and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educational institutions, industry and nonprofit organizations. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal.

Description and Purpose\r\n \r\n    ODEP will award one cooperative agreement to establish a national \r\ntechnical assistance and research center for increasing employment and \r\neconomic independence for adults with disabilities. The overall purpose \r\nof this effort is to build leadership and partnership across workforce \r\ndevelopment, economic development, and relevant partner agencies and \r\nsystems, including generic and disability-specific agencies and \r\nsystems, so that they work together strategically and effectively to \r\nincrease employment outcomes and economic self-sufficiency for adults \r\nwith disabilities. The Center will: Conduct research to identify, \r\nvalidate, document, and otherwise promote effective practices and \r\npolicies in targeted goal areas; develop and disseminate information; \r\nprovide technical assistance; encourage collaboration and partnership \r\nacross State and local generic and disability-specific systems and \r\nprograms, both public and private; and work with States and localities \r\non multiple strategies in targeted goal areas for improving employment \r\noutcomes and economic self-sufficiency for adults with disabilities. \r\nActivities of the Center must be based on the assumptions that: people \r\nwith disabilities have the ability to make and implement decisions \r\n(with support as appropriate) about their own work life, and that they \r\nhave the ability to mobilize and develop resources (with support as \r\nnecessary) to move from poverty and dependency to independence and \r\nproductivity through employment. They must also be based on the \r\nassumption that there is a need for multiple generic and disability-\r\nspecific systems and services to effectively partner across traditional \r\nboundaries. In accomplishing these goals, the Center will provide \r\ntransformational leadership for translating innovation and emerging \r\nsuccessful solutions from isolated demonstrations to systemic \r\npractices, and will act as a voice for elevating the discussion about \r\nemployment and disability nationally.\r\n    The Center's research-related activities will improve systems \r\ncapacity to provide leadership for increasing employment and economic \r\nself-sufficiency at the State and local level in targeted goal areas, \r\nand must include the development of policy-related recommendations for \r\nconsideration across agencies and systems.

Partners may \r\ninclude but are not limited to the following entities:\r\n    (1) State departments and agencies across generic and disability-\r\nspecific systems such as departments of Labor, Economic Development, \r\nVocational Rehabilitation, Veterans Affairs, Mental Health, Medicaid, \r\nMental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities, Education, and Temporary \r\nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF); and Governors' Committees on \r\nEmployment of People with Disabilities and Developmental Disability \r\nCouncils;\r\n    (2) Local Work Investment Act (WIA) service providers, employment \r\nservice providers, local One-Stop Career Centers and the Veterans \r\nEmployment and Training Service; State and local financial services \r\nentities; social security benefits planning and assistance programs; \r\ncommunity and faith-based organizations and disability organizations; \r\ncommunity colleges and other training entities; and providers of \r\nemployment-related supports, including public housing and \r\ntransportation authorities;\r\n    (3) Employers and their professional networks;\r\n    (4) Federal agencies including the Departments of Labor, Health and \r\nHuman Services, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Treasury, \r\nTransportation, Education, and Veterans' Affairs; the Small Business \r\nAdministration and Social Security Administration; and other generic \r\nand disability-specific agencies that work in areas related to \r\nimproving employment and economic self-sufficiency for adults with \r\ndisabilities and others with complex barriers to employment; and\r\n    (5) ODEP-sponsored and other Federal technical assistance projects \r\nthat provide information about, or work in areas related to, employment \r\n(including self employment), economic development, and/or enhancing \r\nemployment profitability through use of relevant tax incentives, \r\nfinancial literacy, work incentives, benefits assistance and related \r\nareas).\r\n    Additionally, the Center will work with ODEP to implement on-site, \r\nintensive, targeted technical assistance and research in two pilot \r\nstates or economic development regions. The pilot project will be \r\ncompetitively selected by the third quarter of year 1 of Center \r\nactivities. Staff and expert consultant time and project resources \r\ndedicated to provide technical assistance, research, and training \r\nsupport to the competitively selected states or regions will be \r\nnegotiated with ODEP as part of the Cooperative Agreement within thirty \r\n(30) days of the date of the award in year 1. However, it is expected \r\nthat a minimum of $600,000 is to be spent on the above component of the \r\nwork plan. Year 1 activities will include the development of targeted \r\ntechnical assistance materials, a work plan (to be approved by ODEP) \r\nfor this component of Center activities, and design and implementation \r\nof a competitive selection process for the states or economic \r\ndevelopment regions. Intensive, on-site, targeted activities will begin \r\nimmediately with the competitively selected states or regions no later \r\nthan the first quarter of year 2 of Center activities, and will focus \r\non implementation of goal areas defined in this SGA throughout the \r\nstates or economic development regions. Additional funding for this \r\nactivity will be dedicated to this component of Center activities \r\nduring years 3-5 pending ODEP's exercise of the option periods provided \r\nherein, and the availability of funds and adequacy of performance.\r\n    The remainder of the funding that is provided is to be spent on \r\ncarrying out the general technical assistance, research, and training \r\nfunctions in targeted goal areas described previously.\r\n \r\n"

This Research Announcement offers a venue by which research ideas proposed by young faculty can be sponsored and promoted within the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) at DARPA.  The Young Faculty Award (YFA) is expected to provide MTO with revolutionary research ideas that are critical to future technology developments.  \r\n\r\nThis solicitation is for single-author grant proposals for concept development and validation in one, or combinations of, the following thrust areas of interest to MTO: 1) electronics, 2) photonics, 3) micro and nano electro mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), 4) architectures, and 5) algorithms.  Proposers must select one of these thrust areas for their proposal and identify this thrust on the cover page.  Proposed research should focus on innovations that enable revolutionary advances in physics, materials, and devices.  Speculative and high-risk ideas are strongly encouraged.  The proposal should clearly state the problem being addressed, the proposed solution, and critical milestones the YFA research activity will address.  Note the problem statement can be broader than the focused effort addressed in the first year of research, but the interrelationship of the two must be clearly articulated.  The initial research should focus on a clearly defined problem which can be answered in a 12 to 18-month activity consisting of critical analysis, design, or experimental exploration.  MTO expects that successful YFA efforts will be a precursor and proof of a concept solution to a larger problem that is sufficiently important and challenging to warrant a follow-on, full-scale DARPA program embodied in a future Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  This solicitation is limited to participation by young investigators as defined in the Proposer Eligibility section.  \r\n\r\nSee Research Announcement."

Of particular interest are projects that build the human and institutional capacity to effectively conserve and manage natural protected areas in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nProgram objectives are:\r\n1)\tTo advance, through capacity building, the transition of protected areas from legally established but under-implemented paper parks to effectively managed landscapes, benefiting species of regional concern; and\r\n2)\tTo develop, strengthen and replicate high-quality conservation training programs that reach the priority audiences associated with protected areas.\r\n\r\nThe priority audiences for the training supported by this Program include: Protected area managers and administrators; Protected area guards and rangers; Protected area outreach and education specialists; Community leaders (living in and around protected areas); Upper-level students (working on projects in and around protected areas); and Decision-makers who influence protected areas (including private landowners, legislators, public officials).\r\n\r\nThe subject areas for training/capacity building initiatives that this Program seeks to support include: \r\n \r\n\tProtected Area/Buffer Zone Management\r\n\tSustainable Natural Resource Management\r\n\tGeneral Ecology and Biodiversity Practice\r\n\tPrivate Management/Co-management\r\n\tLaw: Policy Understanding and Enforcement\r\n\tMonitoring & Evaluation (species and populations)\r\n\tWildlife Disease\r\n\tHuman-Wildlife Conflict\r\n\tIllegal Hunting\r\n\tEcosystem Rehabilitation/Restoration\r\n\tCommunity Engagement/Public Participation\r\n\tEnvironmental Education and Outreach\r\n\tEnvironmental Leadership & Governance Development\t\r\n\tConflict Resolution/Management\r\n\tParticipatory Public Policy Development\r\n\tBest Practices\r\n\tConservation Incentives (economic or other)\r\n\tConservation Finance Mechanisms\r\n\tSustainable Development and Ecotourism\r\n\tSustainable Resource Use (harvest  & collection)\r\n\tProject Development/Management\r\n\tGrant Writing and Fundraising\r\n\tIncreasing Media Awareness\r\n\tEstablishing/Managing Partnerships (with domestic and international institutions/agencies that directly or indirectly influence protected areas)\r\n\tTraining Needs Assessment (identify & prioritize)\r\nNote: this list does not exclude other possible relevant topics, and not all subject areas will be relevant to all audiences.\r\n\r\nProjects should take place in Latin America or the Caribbean, ideally in a recognized high priority ecosystem or ecoregion of biome, or a key location associated with flagship, endangered or migratory species of regional concern.  If work is to be conducted outside that region, the proposal must explain why it is preferable that the project is implemented elsewhere.    \r\n"
